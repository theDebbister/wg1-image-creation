# Image creation

This repository contains the code to create the images for the MultiplEYE experiment. The folder `stimuli_toy` contains
examples of all input files that are necessary and the output files that will eventually be generated. You can always
refer to these as an examples.

## Prepare stimulus files

Please follow the instructions in the MultiplEYE guidelines linked on this page to prepare the stimulus files: 
[MultiplEYE contribute](https://multipleye.eu/contribute/)

### For RTL texts
When there are English chunks of the texts and they are displayed in the
created images in wrong order, they order need to be changed in the xlsx file. For example:
if the ":1" is displayed in the wrong order, it needs to be changed to "1:". 
The program has a problem when changing from RTL to LTR texts within one image.

## Create the images

The readme gives a step by step explanation of what to do to create the images for the MultiplEYE experiment.
The steps below are to be performed if the images are created to be tested and checked for typos etc.

1. Please read the guidelines on the [MultiplEYE contribute](https://multipleye.eu/contribute/) page carefully before starting the image creation. 
Make sure you have all the necessary files and the data collection has been preregistered. Make sure to have the preregistration file at hand.
2. Create a new folder for the images of your lab that is called "stimuli_[dataset title]". The dataset title is specified in the preregistration file. 
For example: "stimuli_MultiplEYE_DE_CH_Zurich_1_2025".
3. Copy the Excel files for the stimuli texts, the questions and the instruction screens into that folder.
4. Create a folder called "config" in the new folder. 
5. In that config folder you create a file called "[dataset title]_lab_configuration.json".
6. Now you copy the content of the preregistration file into the lab configuration file. Make sure that all the curly braces are included
7. Go to the `image_config.py` file and set the variables `LANGUAGE`, `COUNTRY_CODE`, `CITY`, `LAB_NUMBER` and `YEAR` 
on top of the file to the language you want to create the images for (the same values as in the preregistration form).
8. If the images are created for testing purposes, set the variable `TESTING_IMAGES` to `True`. This is the case, when 
you create the images for the first time and people are checking for typos etc.
9. Run `text_to_picture.py`
10. Upload the stimuli folder to the SwitchDrive folder of the respective language.
11. Repeat the generation if necessary (i.e. if there are typos etc.). Make sure to upload a new folder each time and 
put the other one in an archive folder on the Drive.


### Creating the final images
If the images have been checked and the lab decides to start with the piloting, the images need to be created again 
one last time.

> NOTE: there is a bug currently that causes the images to be blurry (ONLY when presented within the experiment, 
> not visible here). Something that seems to help is to slightly reduce the image width, i.e. setting it to 36.5 instead of 
> 37 in the `image_config.py` file. 

1. Once the images have been checked according to the guidelines, set the variable `TESTING_IMAGES` to `False`. 
Now, more version will be created which means the process can take a lot longer!
2. If the lab uses multiple devices, please contact [multipleye@cl.uzh.ch](mailto:multipleye@cl.uzh.ch).
2. As soon as the images have been generated, upload the entire folder to the SwitchDrive folder of the respective language.

### What if the lab notices a typo after the piloting has started?
In this case, it is very important to make a copy of the stimulus folder FROM THE EXPERIMENT (not the one on drive 
nor the one here)!! Some files change during the experiment,
and we need to keep those. So:
1. Copy the entire data folder and save it on SwitchDrive in a folder that is clearly named: I.e.
`data_piloting_[dataset title]_participant_id_1_to_10`. 
2. Now, go back to the original stimuli files and make the necessary changes (i.e. correct typos) and regenerate the images again.
3. Replace the stimulus folder in the experiment by the new one. Run a test session to see that it works.
4. Go to the copy of the old stimulus images and copy this file: `stimuli.../config/stimulus_order_versions ... .csv`. This is the file
that contains the information on what stimulus versions have been used for which participant.
5. Go to the newley generated stimuli that you have copied to the experiment. Search for the file with the same name and paste the content of the old file into that file.
6. This process makes sure we store the information about which stimuli versions have been used already by which participant in the new stimuli images.

## Requirements

In order to run the scripts you need to install the necessary Python packages. It is best if you set up a
clean Python environment to do so. If you use an IDE you can create the environment there. For example for
PyCharm you can follow these [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html).

Once you have the environment you can install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

In order to create images for right-to-left scripts, it is necessary to install more dependencies.


## Text length requirements

### Length of stimulus texts
For the default setting of `IMAGE_SIZE_CM = (37, 28)` the following applies:

The maximum number of character per line is 82. And the maximum number of lines per page is 9. This means that the last
line will be above the fixation dot in the corner of the screen.
However, as we do not split the words, if a word, for example, makes the line 85 characters long, 
this entire word will be moved to the next line. So the maximum number of chars per page is in theory 738, 
but in reality this is rarely the case as the words usually donâ€™t perfectly fit on the lines. 
So, if you like to count by hand, how the pages fit, you can just determine the first word that exceeds the line 
limit (>82 chars) and this word will then be the first word of the new line, until you reach 9 lines.

The maximum number of characters can be specified in the `image_config.py` file using the variable MAX_CHARS_PER_LINE.
Changing this might cause the text to overflow the page!!

> NOTE: this is different for the participant instructions screens, where more characters per line and lines are allowed.
> It has not been a problem so far for any language that it would not fit. If it does not fit, one of the instructions screens
> can simply be split into two screens in the Excel file.

### Length of question-answer-options
The answer options to the questions have a maximum length as well. There are two types of boxes that each answer option can appear in.
This means we have to test for each option whether it fits in both boxes (and especially whether it fits in the smaller one).
As per default, 10 versions of the images with shuffled answer options will be created, all options should appear in each box type at least
once across all versions. If an option does not, the script will show a warning message but continue. In addition, as people also check
every screen manually, it will be noticed if an option does not fit.

#### Manually testing the answer option lengths
In order to test whether the answer options fit in the boxes
you need to do the following steps:
1. Set the variable `NUM_PERMUTATIONS` in the `image_config.py` file to 1
2. Go to the file `text_to_picture.py` and change the following lines (line 224 ca.):
```python
# shuffled_option_keys = ['left', 'up', 'right', 'down']
shuffled_option_keys = ['up', 'left', 'down', 'right']
# random.shuffle(shuffled_option_keys)
```
You should comment the random shuffle step so it won't shuffle the answer options but will be hardcoded for each question.
3. Run the script `text_to_picture.py`. If an option does not fit, it will show an error message. Please copy it once the script it through.
4. Now you need to go to the `text_to_picture.py` file and change the hardcoded positions of the answer options. This way, you can test all box types for all options.
```python
shuffled_option_keys = ['left', 'up', 'right', 'down']
# shuffled_option_keys = ['up', 'left', 'down', 'right']
# random.shuffle(shuffled_option_keys)
```
5. Now you need to go to the config folder in the stimulus folder of the respective language. E.g. for the toy example 
it is `data/stimuli_toy_x_1/config/` and delete the entire folder called `question_answer_option_shuffling_tox_x_1`.
You need it to make sure that the script will not use the shuffled options but the hardcoded ones.
6. Repeat step 3.
7. If all options fit, you can now set the `NUM_PERMUTATIONS` back to its original value and the random shuffle back to the original state.
