12,Arg_PisaCowsMilk,Cow's Milk,"Introduction
In some places, like the United States, drinking cow’s milk is common.
Imagine that three students, Anna, Christopher and Sam, are at a coffee shop in the United States. The owner recently placed a sign in the window that stated: “After April 5th we will no longer serve cow’s milk here. Instead, we will offer a milk substitute made from soy.”
Anna, Christopher and Sam are curious about why the coffee shop would stop serving cow’s milk, so Anna does an Internet search on her smartphone for “cow’s milk”. They look at the first result and discuss it.","www.farmtomarketdairy.com
FARM TO MARKET DAIRY
The Nutritional Value of Milk: Countless Benefits!","Farm to Market Dairy milk products contain key nutrients: calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and potassium. These vitamins and minerals make Farm to Market Dairy milk products an important part of a healthful diet. Consuming Farm to Market Dairy milk products every day is a great way to ensure that you get the vitamins and minerals your body needs.","Consuming Farm to Market Dairy milk products increases weight loss and helps maintain a healthy weight. Milk increases bone strength and density. It even improves cardiovascular health and helps prevent cancer. One glass of milk is packed with vitamins, minerals, and a wealth of health benefits.","According to Bill Sears, MD, Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California at Irvine, milk contains many important nutrients in one convenient place. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) supports this idea. In fact, the IDFA suggests that many health professionals and groups would also agree.","Milk contains a complete nutrient package of nine essential nutrients. In addition to being an excellent source of calcium and vitamin D, it is a good source of vitamin A, protein and potassium. Dairy is recommended by doctors. Dairy’s role in a healthy diet has long been established by the nutrition and science community. This includes the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Surgeon General, the National Institutes of Health, the American Medical Association’s Council of Scientific Affairs and many other leading health organizations.
International Dairy Foods Association, September 27, 2007","Anna, Christopher and Sam are talking about the decision of the coffee shop owner to stop selling cow’s milk. Sam says, “Maybe cow’s milk is becoming too expensive.” Christopher is looking at his smartphone. “Maybe, but I did a web search on cow’s milk too. I’m going to text you the link to a more recent article that may explain it.”
Anna and Sam open the link Christopher sent and read the article, “Just Say ‘No’ to Cow’s Milk!”","www.healtharticlestoday.com/milk

JUST SAY 'NO' TO COW’S MILK!
By Health Reporter, Dr. R. Garza","Cow’s milk is a big part of many people’s lives in the United States. Babies drink cow’s milk in bottles. Children eat cereal drenched in cow’s milk. Even adults enjoy a cold glass of milk from time to time. Yes, cow’s milk is a huge part of the human diet in many places around the world. However, more and more research is suggesting that milk may not “do a body good” as the popular American advertising slogan claims.","The United States Department of Agriculture, the American Dairy Council, Dairy Management, Inc., and other organizations have worked hard to advocate for milk for many years. They encourage adults to drink at least three glasses of milk a day. However, several studies in the last decade have questioned the bone-strengthening power of milk as well as other claims about the health benefits of milk. The results may surprise you.","One of the most recent and most important studies on the effects of drinking milk was published in the October 2014 issue of the British Medical Journal. The findings in this study led to some powerful assertions about the consumption of milk. In this study over 100 000 people in Sweden were followed over periods of 20-30 years. Researchers found that the female milk drinkers suffered more bone fractures. Additionally, both male and female milk drinkers were more likely to suffer from heart disease and cancer. These staggering results are similar to findings from other studies.","The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) commented on some of the health problems related to the consumption of milk. It claims that milk and dairy products “have little or no benefit for bones.” The PCRM goes further to describe some specific problems associated with milk: “Milk proteins, milk sugar, fat, and saturated fat in dairy products pose health risks for children and encourage the development of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.”","These are serious claims and more studies are needed in order to confirm the findings. However, there is mounting proof that drinking cow’s milk could be less beneficial to our health than originally thought. If these claims become indisputable facts, it may be time to just say `no` to cow´s milk.",,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of the goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?
