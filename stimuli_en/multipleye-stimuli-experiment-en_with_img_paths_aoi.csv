1,PopSci_MultiplEYE,Welcome to MultiplEYE!,"The name ""MultiplEYE"" is a wordplay combining ""multilingualism"" or ""multiple languages"" with ""eye"" from ""eye-tracking"". MultiplEYE is a COST Action funded by the European Union. COST Actions are research networks supported by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology or COST for short. As a funding organisation, COST supports our growing network of researchers across Europe and beyond by providing financial assistance for conducting different networking activities. ","These activities include working group meetings, training schools to share skills with younger researchers, and scientific research visits. The project title of the MultiplEYE COST Action is: Enabling multilingual eye-tracking data collection for human and machine language processing research. This means that the MultiplEYE COST Action aims to foster an interdisciplinary network of research groups working on collecting eye-tracking data from reading in multiple languages. ","The goal is to support the development of a large multilingual eye-tracking corpus and enable researchers to collect data by sharing their knowledge between various fields, including linguistics, psychology, speech and language pathology, and computer science. This data collection can then be used to study human language processing from a psycholinguistic perspective as well as to improve and evaluate computational language processing from a machine-learning perspective.","What is ""eye-tracking""?
Eye tracking is the process of measuring the point of gaze - where you are looking - and the movements of the eyes between fixed points of gaze. The device used to measure the eye positions and eye movements is called an eye tracker. It consists of an infrared camera, using a light frequency that does not bother or hurt the human eye. ","With the help of image recognition algorithms, the eye tracker can estimate gaze points very accurately by knowing the position of the head and eyes, the distance to the screen a participant is looking at and the eye tracker's position. Eye-tracking is a helpful technology for many applications. For example, it can help detect tiredness while driving or it can support applications for screening and training purposes in the medical domain. Eye-tracking is also used in gaming, marketing, and human-computer interaction.","Why is eye-tracking while reading especially interesting for our project?
As you read these words, the eye tracker follows your eye's movements over the text. This provides information about how long you spend looking at a text, or more specifically, how long you spent on each word, which words you skipped, which words you dwelled on, and whether you had to go back and reread parts of the text to understand it better.","As your brain is simultaneously processing the content of the text, your eye movements reflect a lot of the linguistic and cognitive processing going on almost in real time. Thus, the recorded data is a gold mine of information about how we put together a text's meaning and grammatical structures. It shows which parts of the text we struggle with and which parts are easily readable. It is up to the researchers to later explain which linguistic factors caused which type of eye movements.","The motivation behind MultiplEYE is that eye-tracking data is still sparse, especially for more minor languages. Such extensive data collection is a challenge in terms of developing and agreeing on the experimental design, the complexity, and the types of texts to be read by the participants. Other decisions that seem less relevant but are, in fact, very important include the font type and size the text is presented in, the order of the texts, the experiment procedure, and how the data will be processed. ","Receiving eye-tracking data from many participants, including yourself, by reading texts in many different languages will be a great foundation for our research. It will be the main factor in turning our research network into a successful endeavour. We hope to clear the way for advancing research in various subfields of linguistics by supporting and connecting a large group of researchers.

7,Lit_MagicMountain,The Magic Mountain - Foreword ,"The story of Hans Gistorp, which we would here set forth, not on his own account, for in him the reader will make acquaintance with a simple-minded though pleasing young man, but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us highly worth telling — though it must needs be borne in mind, in Hans Castorp’s behalf, that it is his story, and not every story happens to everybody — this story, we say, belongs to the long ago; is already, so to speak, covered with historic mould, and unquestionably to be presented in the tense best suited to a narrative out of the depth or the past. ","That should be no drawback to a story, but rather the reverse. Since histories must be in the past, then the more past the better, it would seem, for them in their character as histories, and for him, the teller of them, rounding wizard of times gone by. With this story, moreover, it stands as it does to-day with human beings, not least among them writers of tales: it is far older than its years; its age may not be measured by length of days, nor the weight of time on its head reckoned by the rising or setting of suns. In a word, the degree of its antiquity has noways to do with the passage of time — in which statement the author intentionally touches upon the strange and questionable double nature of that riddling element. ","But we would not wilfully obscure a plain matter. The exaggerated pastness of our narrative is due to its taking place before the epoch when a certain crisis shattered its way through life and consciousness and left a deep chasm behind. It takes place — or, rather, deliberately to avoid the present tense, it took place, and had taken place — in the long ago, in the old days, the days of the world before the Great War, in the beginning of which so much began that has scarcely yet left off beginning. Yes, it took place before that; yet not so long before. Is not the pastness of the past the profounder, the completer, the more legendary, the more immediately before the present it falls? ","More than that, our story has, of its own nature, something of the legend about it now and again. We shall tell it at length, thoroughly, in detail - for when did a narrative seem too long or too short by reason of the actual time or space it took up? We do not fear being called meticulous, inclining as we do to the view that only the exhaustive can be truly interesting. ","Not all in a minute, then, will the narrator be finished with the story of our Hans. The seven days of a week will not suffice, no, nor seven months either. Best not too soon make too plain how much mortal time must pass over his head while he sits spun round in his spell. Heaven forbid it should be seven years!

9,Lit_Solaris,Solaris - Chapter 2: The Solarists,"The discovery of Solaris dated from about 100 years before I was born. The planet orbits two suns: a red sun and a blue sun. For 45 years after its discovery, no spacecraft had visited Solaris. At that time, the Gamow-Shapley theory — that life was impossible on planets which are satellites of two solar bodies — was firmly believed. The orbit is constantly being modified by variations in the gravitational pull in the course of its revolutions around the two suns. ","Due to these fluctuations in gravity, the orbit is either flattened or distended and the elements of life, if they appear, are inevitably destroyed, either by intense heat or an extreme drop in temperature. These changes take place at intervals estimated in millions of years — very short intervals, that is, according to the laws of astronomy and biology (evolution takes hundreds of millions of years if not a billion). ","According to the earliest calculations, in 500,000 years’ time Solaris would be drawn one half of an astronomic unit nearer to its red sun, and a million years after that would be engulfed by the incandescent star. A few decades later, however, observations seemed to suggest that the planet’s orbit was in no way subject to the expected variations: it was stable, as stable as the orbit of the planets in our own solar system. ",The observations and calculations were reworked with great precision; they simply confirmed the original conclusions: Solaris’s orbit was unstable. A modest item among the hundreds of planets discovered annually — to which official statistics devoted only a few lines defining the characteristics of their orbits — Solaris eventually began to attract special attention and attain a high rank. ,"Four years after this promotion, overflying the planet with the Laakon and two auxiliary craft, the Ottenskjold expedition undertook a study of Solaris. This expedition being in the nature of a preliminary, not to say improvised reconnaissance, the scientists were not equipped for a landing. Ottenskjold placed a quantity of automatic observation satellites into equatorial and polar orbit, their principal function being to measure the gravitational pull. ","In addition, a study was made of the planet’s surface, which is covered by an ocean dotted with innumerable flat, low-lying islands whose combined area is less than that of Europe, although the diameter of Solaris is a fifth greater than Earth’s. These expanses of barren, rocky territory, irregularly distributed, are largely concentrated in the southern hemisphere.","At the same time the composition of the atmosphere — devoid of oxygen — was analyzed, and precise measurements made of the planet’s density, from which its albedo and other astronomical characteristics were determined. As was foreseeable, no trace of life was discovered, either on the islands or in the ocean. ","During the following ten years, Solaris became the center of attraction for all observatories oncerned with the study of this region of space, for the planet had in the meantime shown the astonishing faculty of maintaining an orbit which ought, without any shadow of doubt, to have been unstable. The problem almost developed into a scandal: since the results of the observations could only be inaccurate, attempts were made (in the interests of science) to denounce and discredit various scientists or else the computers they used. ","Lack of funds delayed the departure of a proper Solaris expedition for three years. Finally Shannahan assembled his team and obtained three C-tonnage vessels from the Institute, the largest starships of the period. A year and a half before the arrival of the expedition, which left from the region of Alpha in Aquarius, a second exploration fleet, acting in the name of the Institute, placed an automatic satellite — Luna 247 — into orbit around Solaris. ","This satellite, after three successive reconstructions at roughly ten-year intervals, is still functioning today. The data it supplied confirmed beyond doubt the findings of the Ottenskjold expedition concerning the active character of the ocean’s movements. One of Shannahan’s ships remained in orbit, while the two others, after some preliminary attempts, landed in the southern hemisphere, in a rocky area about 600 miles square. ","The work of the expedition lasted eighteen months and was carried out under favorable conditions, apart from an unfortunate accident brought about by the malfunction of some apparatus. In the meantime, the scientists had split into two opposing camps; the bone of contention was the ocean. On the basis of the analyses, it had been accepted that the ocean was an organic formation (at that time, no one had yet dared to call it living). ","But, while the biologists considered it as a primitive formation — a sort of gigantic entity, a fluid cell, unique and monstrous (which they called ‘prebiological’), surrounding the globe with a colloidal envelope several miles thick in places — the astronomers and physicists asserted that it must be an organic structure, extraordinarily evolved. According to them, the ocean possibly exceeded terrestrial organic structures in complexity, since it was capable of exerting an active influence on the planet’s orbital path. ","Certainly, no other factor could be found that might explain the behavior of Solaris; moreover, the planetophysicists had established a relationship between certain processes of the plasmic ocean and the local measurements of gravitational pull, which altered according to the ‘matter transformations’ of the ocean. Consequently it was the physicists, rather than the biologists, who put forward the paradoxical formulation of a ‘plasmic mechanism,’ implying by this a structure, possibly without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities — on an astronomic scale, it should be emphasized. ","It was during this quarrel, whose reverberations soon reached the ears of the most eminent authorities, that the Gamow-Shapley doctrine, unchallenged for eighty years, was shaken for the first time. There were some who continued to support the Gamow-Shapley contentions, to the effect that the ocean had nothing to do with life, that it was neither ‘parabiological’ nor ‘prebiological’ but a geological formation — of extreme rarity, it is true — with the unique ability to stabilize the orbit of Solaris, despite the variations in the forces of attraction. Le Chatelier’s law was enlisted in support of this argument. ","To challenge this conservative attitude, new hypotheses were advanced — of which Civito-Vitta’s was one of the most elaborate — proclaiming that the ocean was the product of a dialectical development: on the basis of its earliest pre-oceanic form, a solution of slow-reacting chemical elements, and by the force of circumstances (the threat to its existence from the changes of orbit), it had reached in a single bound the stage of ‘homeostatic ocean,’ without passing through all the stages of terrestrial evolution, by-passing the unicellular and multicellular phases, the vegetable and the animal, the development of a nervous and cerebral system."," In other words, unlike terrestrial organisms, it had not taken hundreds of millions of years to adapt itself to its environment — culminating in the first representatives of a species endowed with reason — but dominated its environment immediately. This was an original point of view. Nevertheless, the means whereby this colloidal envelope was able to stabilize the planet’s orbit remained unknown. For almost a century, devices had existed capable of creating artificial magnetic and gravitational fields; they were called gravitors. ","But no one could even guess how this formless glue could produce an effect which the gravitors achieved by the use of complicated nuclear reactions and enormously high temperatures. The newspapers of the day, exciting the curiosity of the layman and the anger of the scientist, were full of the most improbable embroideries on the theme of the ‘Solaris Mystery,’ one reporter going so far as to suggest that the ocean was, no less, a distant relation to our electric eels! Just when a measure of success had been achieved in unravelling this problem, it turned out, as often happened subsequently in the field of Solarist studies, that the explanation replaced one enigma by another, perhaps even more baffling.","Observations showed, at least, that the ocean did not react according to the same principles as our gravitors (which, in any case, would have been impossible), but succeeded in controlling the orbital periodicity directly. One result, among others, was the discovery of discrepancies in the measurement of time along one and the same meridian on Solaris.

10,Lit_BrokenApril,Broken April - Chapter 3,"Holding his wife’s hand, Bessian Vorpsi moved his head close to the window to make sure that the small town they had left half an hour before, the last one at the foot of the Rrafsh, the high plateau of the north, had disappeared from view. Now, before them and on either side there stretched away heathland on a slight slope, a rather strange piece of country, neither plain, nor mountain nor plateau. ","The mountains, properly speaking, had not yet begun, but one felt their looming shadow, and it seemed that it was that very shadow which while rejecting any connection between the plateau and the mountain world, kept it from being classed as a plain. So it was a border region, barren and almost uninhabited.","“The Accursed Mountains,” he said softly, with a slight tremor in his voice, as if he were greeting a vision that he had been expecting for a very long time. He felt that the name, with its solemnity, had made an impression on his wife, and he took a certain satisfaction in it.","Her face came closer, and he breathed in the perfume of her neck.
“Where are they?”
He nodded ahead, and then he pointed, but in that direction she saw nothing but a heavy layer of mist.
“You can’t see anything yet,” he explained. “We’re far away from them.”","She left her hand in her husband’s and leaned back into the velvet cloth of her seat. The jostling of the carriage sent the newspaper in which they were mentioned, and which they had bought in the small town a little before their departure, sliding to the floor, but neither of them moved to pick it up. She smiled vaguely, recalling the title of the short piece announcing their trip: “Sensation: The writer, Bessian Vorpsi, and his young bride are spending their honeymoon on the Northern Plateau!”","The article was rather vague. You could not tell whether the author, a certain A.G. (could that be their acquaintance, Adrian Guma?) was in favor of the trip or was being slightly ironic about it.","She herself, when her fiance had announced it to her two weeks before the wedding, had thought the idea pretty bizarre. Don’t be surprised at anything, her friends had told her. If you marry a man who’s a bit odd, you have to expect surprises. But at bottom we have to say you’re very lucky.","And in fact she was happy. During the last days before the wedding, in the half-fashionable, half-artistic circles of Tirana, people talked about nothing but their honeymoon trip. Her friends envied her and told her: You’ll be escaping the world of reality for the world of legend, literally the world of epic that scarcely exists anymore. ","And they would go on talking about fairies, mountain nymphs, bards, the last Homeric hymns in the world, and the Kanun, terrifying but so majestic. Others shrugged their shoulders at all this enthusiasm, hinting discreetly at their astonishment, which was aroused particularly by the question of comfort, the more so since this was a honeymoon trip, something that called for certain conveniences, whereas, in the mountains the weather was still quite cold, and those epic kullas were of stone.","On the other hand, there were others— few in number—who listened to all those opinions with a rather amused air, as if to say, “Right, go on up north among the mountain nymphs. It will do both of you good, and especially Bessian.",,,,,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_1_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_1_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_2_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_2_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_3_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_3_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_4_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_4_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_5_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_5_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_6_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_6_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_7_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_7_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_8_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_8_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_9_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_9_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_10_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_10_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_page_11_en_aoi.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_page_11_en_aoi.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_question_1_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/lit_brokenapril_id10_question_3_en.png,lit_brokenapril_id10_question_3_en.png,,,,
11,Arg_PisaRapaNui,Rapa Nui,"Introduction
Imagine that a local library is hosting a lecture next week. The lecture will be given by a professor from a nearby university. She will discuss her field work on the island of Rapa Nui in the Pacific Ocean, over 3200 kilometres west of Chile.
",Your history class will attend the lecture. Your teacher asks you to research the history of Rapa Nui so that you will know something about it before you attend the lecture.,"www.theprofessorblog.com/fieldwork/RapaNui
The Professor’s Blog
Posted May 23, 11:22 a.m.","As I look out of my window this morning, I see the landscape I have learned to love here on Rapa Nui, which is known in some places by the name Easter Island. The grasses and shrubs are green, the sky is blue, and the old, now extinct volcanoes rise up in the background.","I am a bit sad knowing that this is my last week on the island. I have finished my field work and will be returning home. Later today, I will take a walk through the hills and say good-bye to the moai that I have been studying for the past nine months. Here is a picture of some of these massive statues.","If you have been following my blog this year, then you know that the people of Rapa Nui carved these moai hundreds of years ago. These impressive moai had been carved in a single quarry on the eastern part of the island. Some of them weighed thousands of kilos, yet the people of Rapa Nui were able to move them to locations far away from the quarry without cranes or any heavy equipment.","For years, archeologists did not know how these massive statues were moved. It remained a mystery until the 1990s, when a team of archeologists and residents of Rapa Nui demonstrated that the moai could have been transported and raised using ropes made from plants and wooden rollers and tracks made from large trees that had once thrived on the island. The mystery of the moai was solved.","Another mystery remained, however. What happened to these plants and large trees that had been used to move the moai? As I said, when I look out of my window, I see grasses and shrubs and a small tree or two, but nothing that could have been used to move these huge statues. It is a fascinating puzzle, one that I will explore in future posts and lectures. Until then, you may wish to investigate the mystery yourself. I suggest you begin with a book called Collapse by Jared Diamond. This review of Collapse is a good place to start.","Traveler_14 May 24, 4:31 p.m.
""Hi Professor! I love following your work on Easter Island. I can’t wait to check out Collapse!""

Review of Collapse","Jared Diamond’s new book, Collapse, is a clear warning about the consequences of damaging our environment. In the book, the author describes several civilizations that collapsed because of the choices they made and their impact on the environment. One of the most disturbing examples in the book is Rapa Nui.","According to the author, Rapa Nui was settled by Polynesians sometime after 700 CE. They developed a thriving society of, perhaps, 15 000 people. They carved the moai, the famous statues, and used the natural resources available to them to move these huge moai to different locations around the island. When the first Europeans landed on Rapa Nui in 1722, the moai were still there, but the trees were gone. ",The population was down to a few thousand people who were struggling to survive. Mr. Diamond writes that the people of Rapa Nui cleared the land for farming and other purposes and that they over-hunted the numerous species of sea and land birds that had lived on the island. He speculates that the dwindling natural resources led to civil wars and the collapse of Rapa Nui’s society.,"The lesson of this wonderful but frightening book is that in the past, humans made the choice to destroy their environment by cutting down all the trees and hunting animal species to extinction. Optimistically, the author points out, we can choose not to make the same mistakes today. The book is written well and deserves to be read by anyone who is concerned about the environment.",,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_1_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_1_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_2_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_2_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_3_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_3_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_4_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_4_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_5_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_5_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_6_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_6_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_7_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_7_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_8_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_8_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_9_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_9_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_10_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_10_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_11_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_11_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_12_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_12_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_13_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_13_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_14_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_14_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_15_en_aoi.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_page_15_en_aoi.png,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_1_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_3_en.png,arg_pisarapanui_id11_question_3_en.png,,,,
12,Arg_PisaCowsMilk,Cow's Milk,"Introduction
In some places, like the United States, drinking cow’s milk is common.
Imagine that three students, Anna, Christopher and Sam, are at a coffee shop in the United States. The owner recently placed a sign in the window that stated: “After April 5th we will no longer serve cow’s milk here. Instead, we will offer a milk substitute made from soy.”
Anna, Christopher and Sam are curious about why the coffee shop would stop serving cow’s milk, so Anna does an Internet search on her smartphone for “cow’s milk”. They look at the first result and discuss it.",The first source you will read is a blog entry written by the professor while she was living on Rapa Nui.,"Farm to Market Dairy milk products contain key nutrients: calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and potassium. These vitamins and minerals make Farm to Market Dairy milk products an important part of a healthful diet. Consuming Farm to Market Dairy milk products every day is a great way to ensure that you get the vitamins and minerals your body needs.","Consuming Farm to Market Dairy milk products increases weight loss and helps maintain a healthy weight. Milk increases bone strength and density. It even improves cardiovascular health and helps prevent cancer. One glass of milk is packed with vitamins, minerals, and a wealth of health benefits.","According to Bill Sears, MD, Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California at Irvine, milk contains many important nutrients in one convenient place. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) supports this idea. In fact, the IDFA suggests that many health professionals and groups would also agree.","Milk contains a complete nutrient package of nine essential nutrients. In addition to being an excellent source of calcium and vitamin D, it is a good source of vitamin A, protein and potassium. Dairy is recommended by doctors. Dairy’s role in a healthy diet has long been established by the nutrition and science community. This includes the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Surgeon General, the National Institutes of Health, the American Medical Association’s Council of Scientific Affairs and many other leading health organizations.
International Dairy Foods Association, September 27, 2007","Anna, Christopher and Sam are talking about the decision of the coffee shop owner to stop selling cow’s milk. Sam says, “Maybe cow’s milk is becoming too expensive.” Christopher is looking at his smartphone. “Maybe, but I did a web search on cow’s milk too. I’m going to text you the link to a more recent article that may explain it.”
Anna and Sam open the link Christopher sent and read the article, “Just Say ‘No’ to Cow’s Milk!”","www.healtharticlestoday.com/milk

JUST SAY 'NO' TO COW’S MILK!
By Health Reporter, Dr. R. Garza","Cow’s milk is a big part of many people’s lives in the United States. Babies drink cow’s milk in bottles. Children eat cereal drenched in cow’s milk. Even adults enjoy a cold glass of milk from time to time. Yes, cow’s milk is a huge part of the human diet in many places around the world. However, more and more research is suggesting that milk may not “do a body good” as the popular American advertising slogan claims.","The United States Department of Agriculture, the American Dairy Council, Dairy Management, Inc., and other organizations have worked hard to advocate for milk for many years. They encourage adults to drink at least three glasses of milk a day. However, several studies in the last decade have questioned the bone-strengthening power of milk as well as other claims about the health benefits of milk. The results may surprise you.","One of the most recent and most important studies on the effects of drinking milk was published in the October 2014 issue of the British Medical Journal. The findings in this study led to some powerful assertions about the consumption of milk. In this study over 100 000 people in Sweden were followed over periods of 20-30 years. Researchers found that the female milk drinkers suffered more bone fractures. Additionally, both male and female milk drinkers were more likely to suffer from heart disease and cancer. These staggering results are similar to findings from other studies.","The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) commented on some of the health problems related to the consumption of milk. It claims that milk and dairy products “have little or no benefit for bones.” The PCRM goes further to describe some specific problems associated with milk: “Milk proteins, milk sugar, fat, and saturated fat in dairy products pose health risks for children and encourage the development of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.”","These are serious claims and more studies are needed in order to confirm the findings. However, there is mounting proof that drinking cow’s milk could be less beneficial to our health than originally thought. If these claims become indisputable facts, it may be time to just say `no` to cow´s milk.",,,,,,,multiple choice,multiple choice,multiple choice,,,What is one of  goals of the MultiplEYE COST action?,,What is a challenge of MultiplEYE?,,,To study how people learn for exams.,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,To find out if people read a lot.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,It is not really useful but researchers just find it fun to study it.,We can find out if two people are related.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,That there is no money provided for networking activitites.,There is already too much data available.,,,,,,,a,b,c,,,,a,b,c,,,,,,,answer_option_1_2,answer_option_2_1,answer_option_3_1,,,To investigate how the brain processes texts while reading.,It can be used to find out if people are tired.,To coordinate between different reasearch groups.,,,b,,a,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_1_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_1_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_2_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_2_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_3_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_3_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_4_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_4_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_5_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_5_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_6_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_6_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_7_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_7_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_8_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_8_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_9_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_9_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_10_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_10_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_11_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_11_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_12_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_12_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_13_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_13_en_aoi.png,stimuli_en/stimuli_aoi_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_14_en_aoi.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_page_14_en_aoi.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_1_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_1_en.png,,,stimuli_en/stimuli_images/arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_3_en.png,arg_pisacowsmilk_id12_question_3_en.png,,,,
