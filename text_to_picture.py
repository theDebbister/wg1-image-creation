NOTE that the size 34 and 26 cm does not mean that this will be the displayed size of the image on the monitor,
 this is the size of the image when it will be e.g. printed.
 
 We know the size of the final image in pixels and cm, but display operates only in pixels, it doesn't know his own 
 cm distances and every display has different resolution (number of pixels) and size in inches, that means different 
 displays have different sizes of the single pixel and thus the picture with the same pixel resolution is displayed 
 in different cm sizes on different displays. That means that the presentation program must ensure that the image is 
 presented in the required size (with knowing the specific display information - which might be actually hard to 
 obtain).
